Welcome back to our DevOps journey! Today, we'll explore some basic Linux commands that are essential for every DevOps engineer. 🚀

Let's dive in and discover these commands with a touch of fun and excitement! 🎉

1️⃣ **Viewing File Content** 👀

To satisfy your curiosity and view what's written in a file, you can use the `cat` command. It's like peeking into a treasure chest! 💎

Example:

```bash
$cat myfile.txt
```

2️⃣ **Changing Access Permissions** 🔒

Do you want to be the master of your files? Use the `chmod` command to change the access permissions and take control! 🔐

Example:

```bash
$chmod 755 myfile.sh
```

3️⃣ **Checking Command History** ⏳

Ever wondered how many commands you've conquered on your DevOps journey? The `history` command reveals your past triumphs! ⚔️

Example:

```bash
$history
```

4️⃣ **Removing a Directory** 🗂️

When it's time to bid farewell to a directory or folder, the `rm` command comes to the rescue! 🚫

Example:

```bash
$rm -r mydirectory
```

5️⃣ **Creating and Viewing a File** 📄

To create a file full of fruity goodness, use the `touch` command, like planting a seed. Then, use `cat` to view the vibrant content of the file! 🍎🍌🍒

Example:

```bash
touch fruits.txt
cat fruits.txt
```

6️⃣ **Adding Content to a File** 🖋️

Get your virtual paintbrush ready! Use the `echo` command followed by the redirection symbol (`>>`) to add colorful fruits to the "devops.txt" file. Each fruit on a new line, like a painter's strokes! 🎨

Example:

```bash
$echo "Apple" >> devops.txt
$echo "Mango" >> devops.txt
$echo "Banana" >> devops.txt
```

7️⃣ **Showing Top Three Fruits** 🥇🥈🥉

To pick the cream of the crop, use the `head` command with the `-n` option and specify `3`. It's like awarding medals to the top three fruits! 🏅

Example:

```bash
$head -n 3 devops.txt
```

8️⃣ **Showing Bottom Three Fruits** 🥭🍊🍇

Now, let's give some love to the underdogs! The `tail` command with the `-n` option and `3` as the argument shows the bottom three fruits, like hidden gems waiting to be discovered! 💎

Example:

```bash
$tail -n 3 devops.txt
```

9️⃣ **Creating and Viewing Another File** 🌈

Time to unleash your creativity! Use the `touch` command again to create the "Colors.txt" file. Then, use `cat` to view the enchanting colors written inside. It's like stepping into a vibrant rainbow! 🌈

Example:

```bash
$touch Colors.txt
$cat Colors.txt
```

🔟 **Finding the Difference** 🔄

To spot the dissimilarities between our fruity and colorful files, employ the `diff` command. It unveils the unique aspects, like playing spot-the-difference between two pictures! 🕵️‍♂️

Example:

```bash
$diff fruits.txt Colors.txt
```

And there you have it! These basic Linux commands have become your trusty companions on this DevOps adventure. 🌟
