### Terraform Module vs Workspace: Understanding the Differences with a Docker Provider Example

When working with Terraform, it's crucial to understand how to manage your infrastructure as code in a scalable and maintainable way. Two concepts that often come up are **Terraform Modules** and **Terraform Workspaces**. Though they serve different purposes, both can be used to manage environments and infrastructure variations effectively. In this blog, we'll dive into what these concepts are, how they differ, and provide a detailed example using the Docker provider.

## What is a Terraform Module?

A **Terraform Module** is a container for multiple resources that are used together. A module can be as simple as a single file or as complex as a collection of multiple files and directories. Modules help in organizing and reusing code, making it easier to manage infrastructure that shares common patterns.

### Benefits of Using Modules:

* **Code Reusability:** Modules allow you to reuse the same configuration across different environments or projects.
    
* **Abstraction:** Modules encapsulate the details of how infrastructure is provisioned, allowing you to focus on higher-level configuration.
    
* **Organization:** Modules help in organizing your Terraform code, making it more readable and maintainable.
    

## What is a Terraform Workspace?

A **Terraform Workspace** is an isolated instance of your Terraform state. Workspaces allow you to manage multiple environments (like dev, staging, and production) from the same Terraform configuration by switching between workspaces.

### Benefits of Using Workspaces:

* **Environment Isolation:** Each workspace has its own state, providing isolation between environments.
    
* **Simplicity:** Workspaces allow you to maintain a single Terraform configuration file for multiple environments.
    
* **Flexibility:** You can switch between environments easily using the same configuration.
    

## Module vs. Workspace: When to Use What?

### Modules:

* Use modules when you need to reuse common infrastructure patterns across multiple projects or environments.
    
* Modules are ideal for abstracting complex configurations, such as creating VPCs, security groups, or Kubernetes clusters.
    
* They are also useful for sharing infrastructure best practices within your team.
    

### Workspaces:

* Use workspaces when you need to manage multiple environments (dev, test, prod) that share the same configuration but require isolated states.
    
* Workspaces are suitable when the infrastructure for different environments is nearly identical, with only slight variations.
    

## Example: Docker Provider with Terraform Module and Workspace

Let's explore how to use Terraform Modules and Workspaces with the Docker provider.

### Step 1: Define a Terraform Module for Docker Containers

First, we'll create a Terraform module that defines a Docker container.

**Directory Structure:**

```plaintext
/terraform-docker/
├── /modules/
│   └── /docker-container/
│       ├── main.tf
│       ├── variables.tf
│       └── outputs.tf
├── main.tf
├── variables.tf
└── outputs.tf
```

**/modules/docker-container/**[**main.tf**](http://main.tf)**:**

```json
terraform {
  required_providers {
    docker = {
      source  = "kreuzwerker/docker"
      version = "3.0.2"
    }
  }
}

provider "docker" {
  host = "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
}


resource "docker_image" "nginx" {
  name = "nginx:latest"
}

resource "docker_container" "nginx" {
  image = docker_image.nginx.image_id
  name  = var.container_name
  ports {
    internal = 80
    external = var.external_port
  }
}
```

**/modules/docker-container/**[**variables.tf**](http://variables.tf)**:**

```plaintext
variable "container_name" {
  description = "Name of the Docker container"
  type        = string
}

variable "external_port" {
  description = "External port to map to the container"
  type        = number
}
```

**/modules/docker-container/**[**outputs.tf**](http://outputs.tf)**:**

```plaintext
output "container_id" {
  description = "The ID of the Docker container"
  value       = docker_container.nginx.id
}
```

### Step 2: Use the Module in the Root Configuration

Next, we'll use the module in our root configuration.

**/**[**main.tf**](http://main.tf)**:**

```json
module "nginx_container" {
  source         = "./modules/docker-container"
  container_name = lookup(var.container, terraform.workspace, "default-nginx")
  external_port  = lookup(var.external_port, terraform.workspace, 80)
}
```

### Step 3: Managing Environments with Workspaces

With our module defined, we can now manage different environments using Terraform Workspaces.

1. **Create Workspaces:**
    

```plaintext
terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace new prod
```

2. **Customize Configuration for Each Workspace:**
    

You can use the workspace name to customize the configuration. For example:

**/**[**main.tf**](http://main.tf)**:**

```json
module "nginx_container" {
  source         = "./modules/docker-container"
  container_name = lookup(var.container, terraform.workspace, "default-nginx")
  external_port  = var.external_port
}
```

**/**[**variable.tf**](http://main.tf)**:**

```json
variable "container" {
  description = "Map of container names for different environments"
  type        = map(string)
  default = {
    prod = "prod-nginx"
    dev  = "dev-nginx"
  }
}

variable "external_port" {
  description = "External port to map to the container"
  type        = map(number)
  default     = {
    prod = 1431
    dev  = 8005
  }
}
```

**/**[**output.tf**](http://main.tf)**:**

```json
output "nginx_container_id" {
  description = "The ID of the Docker container"
  value       = module.nginx_container.container_id
}
```

3. **Apply Configuration for Different Workspaces:**
    

```json
# Switch to the development workspace
terraform workspace select dev
terraform apply

# Switch to the production workspace
terraform workspace select prod
terraform apply
```

Each workspace will have its isolated state, ensuring that your development and production environments don't interfere with each other.
