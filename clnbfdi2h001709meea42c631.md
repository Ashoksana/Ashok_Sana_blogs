Today, we‚Äôre diving into the world of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to help you launch your very first Linux Virtual Machine (VM). Don‚Äôt worry if you‚Äôre new to this ‚Äì we've got your back! Let‚Äôs get started on this exciting journey. üòä

### **Step 1: Create a GCP Account üåê**

1. If you haven‚Äôt already, head over to the [**Google Cloud Platform**](https://cloud.google.com/) website, sign in or create an account.
    
2. Follow the instructions to create your account, provide the necessary information and agree to the terms of service.
    
3. Set up billing information to enable GCP services. You will be eligible for a free trial with an initial $300 credits means INR 24969rs to explore GCP and Activate them.

### **Step 2: Access the GCP Console üñ•Ô∏è**

Once you‚Äôre logged in, navigate to the GCP Console. It's your control center for all things cloud-related.

### **Step 3: Create a New Project üèóÔ∏è**

Projects help you organize resources and manage permissions. Create a new project and give it a meaningful name.

### **OR**

Leaving it as the default project means Google Cloud Platform provides you with a default project.

Here I am creating a new project, for that click the dropdown button of "My First Project". it will show as a pop-up.

Here I already created one 1project as custom and another one which created by Gcp default. So, here shows me that i have only 23 projects left for Free trail account.

### **Step 4: Compute Engine APIs üí≥**

Before you start spinning up VMs, make sure billing is enabled for your project. Also, enable necessary APIs such as Compute Engine API.

### **Step 5: Launch a Linux VM üêß**

1. Click on the Navigation menu (‚ò∞) and go to Compute Engine &gt; VM instances.
    
2. Click the ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù button.
    
3. Choose your desired region and zone for your VM.
    
4. Select a machine type. For beginners, a small instance will do just fine.
    
5. Under the Boot disk section, click ‚ÄúChange‚Äù and select a Linux distribution of your choice (like Ubuntu, CentOS, or Debian).
    
6. Set the desired Disk size and click ‚ÄúSelect‚Äù.
    
7. Click ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù to create your VM.
    
8. Configure the firewall settings by selecting "Allow HTTP traffic" or any other ports you need to open.

### **Step 6: Explore and Have Fun! üéâ**

Congratulations! You‚Äôve successfully launched your first Linux VM on GCP. Now you can install software, host websites, or do whatever your heart desires in your cloud-based Linux environment.

### **Step 7: Deletion of VM of Gcp**

After completion of your work with that vm, please delete or stop the instance because it will charged you account untill and unless you stop or delete vm
